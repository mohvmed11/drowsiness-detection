# drowsiness-detection
Drowsiness detection is a critical aspect of ensuring safety in various domains, including transportation, online learning, and multimedia consumption. In this project, we present a thorough investigation of drowsiness detection methods, focusing on the use of CNN and Transfer Learning. We evaluate our approach on various datasets

# datasets:

In the realm of drowsiness detection, the quality and diversity of datasets play a crucial role in the development and evaluation of effective models and systems. Datasets serve as 
the foundation upon which machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks are trained and tested. The selection of appropriate datasets is paramount in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of drowsiness detection systems. In our research, we leveraged a variety of datasets, each offering unique characteristics and challenges, to assess the robustness and 
generalizability of our models.

# Methodology: 

Our proposed system will work on simple principle of counter, wherein a limit time is set above which if the user is found sleepy, then audio/ alarm will be played. The
counter will increase based on the time for which the driverâ€™s eyes are shut. In our project, we aim to compare the performance of CNNs with Transfer Learning (TL) to determine which 
approach is more effective for driver drowsiness detection. This comparative analysis will provide valuable insights into the suitability of CNNs for this safety-critical 
application and help us make an informed choice between CNN-based models and TL-based models.
